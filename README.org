  A command-line application that parses words and integers from an input of the
  form:

  #+BEGIN_SRC
  Ba!!ker 5-5 c 5 a f d 1%0 h e -1
  6!6 car 6 Auto f-!r*8ance dance 1%0 h e -1
  -tonkin 5-5 c 5 a f d 1%0 h e -1
  #+END_SRC

  and produces sorted output of the form:

  #+BEGIN_SRC
  Baker -1 a 5 c d e 10 f h 55
  -1 Auto 6 car dance e 10 france h 66
  a -1 c 5 d e f 10 h tonkin 55
  #+END_SRC

  That is, with words and integers sorted independently (the former
  lexicograpically, the latter numerically), and both sorted lists interleaved
  so that positions occupied by a word/integer remain so after sorting.

** Usage

   To run the script, run the executable in ~./bin/~ with the input file as the
   argument. Output is written to standard output.

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   $ bin/zipsort data/sample.txt
   #+END_SRC

   Alternatively, input can be piped from stdin:

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   $ cat data/sample.txt | bin/zipsort
   #+END_SRC

** Tests

   To run the test suite, issue ~./make-test~:

   #+BEGIN_SRC
   % ./make-test
   .........
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   Ran 9 tests in 0.001s

   OK
   #+END_SRC

** Requirements

   Python 3.6.1
